# Minjoo's User Page for CSE 110 Lab 1
## Introduction

Hello! My name is **Minjoo O**, and I'm a second year <ins>Computer Science</ins> major at UCSD. I'm _extremely_ passionate about programming and learning new things ***every day*** as a student! I'm also very involved on campus, as I am First Year Events intern for ***Women In Computing***, and a Software Developer for ***IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu***.

### Quote
One of the quotes I live by as a student is:
> Start early, start often

I rarely procastinate! I like to get things done _relatively_ early.

### Code
Here are some Git commands I've used for this lab:
```
git clone
git branch
git checkout
git add
git commit
git push
```
### Links
Here is a link to my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/minjoo-o), if you'd like to connect with me.
As I mentioned in my [introduction](#Introduction), I am passionate about programming! What is my favorite programming language, you may ask? Well, you can learn about it in this [README.md](README.md) file.

### Lists
Here are the languages I've used, ranked:
1. Java (just b/c they taught me this first!)
2. C++ (I've had to get real familiar with this through CSE 100 and a team project!)
3. Python (Got experience with this when I was exploring Data Science!)
4. C (my introduction to manual memory management)
5. HTML/CSS (not programming languages, but languages nonetheless)
6. JavaScript (I just use it for websites!)
7. ARM assembly (hard to debug!)
8. MATLAB (used it once for linear algebra)
   
Some things I would get out of this class are:
- How to pitch ideas and advocate for yourself in team settings
- Practice in creatively coding work without being given strict guidelines or expectations
- Networking with likeminded individuals and great mentors!
- Surviving and crushing interviews or code reviews!
- Learn how a software engineer thinks and works like

### Tasks
These are the core CSE classes we must take:
- [x] CSE 11
- [x] CSE 12
- [x] CSE 15L
- [x] CSE 20
- [x] CSE 21
- [x] CSE 30
- [x] CSE 100
- [x] CSE 101
- [ ] CSE 110

As you can see, CSE 110 is the last core CSE class I must take, and I am so excited to learn a lot from this course!
