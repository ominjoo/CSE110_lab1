# Minjoo's User Page for CSE 110 Lab 1

Hello! My name is **Minjoo O**, and I'm a second year <ins>Computer Science</ins> major at UCSD. I'm _extremely_ passionate about programming and learning new things ***every day*** as a student! I'm also very involved on campus, as I am a part of _Women In Computing_, and a Software Developer for _IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu_.

One of the quotes I live by as a student is:
> Start early, start often
I rarely procastinate!
