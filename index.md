# Minjoo's User Page for CSE 110 Lab 1

Hello! My name is **Minjoo O**, and I'm a second year <ins>Computer Science</ins> major at UCSD. I'm _extremely_ passionate about programming and learning new things ***every day*** as a student! I'm also very involved on campus, as I am First Year Events intern for ***Women In Computing***, and a Software Developer for ***IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu***.

One of the quotes I live by as a student is:
> Start early, start often

I rarely procastinate!

Here are some Git commands I've used for this lab:
```
git clone
git branch
git checkout
git add
git commit
git push

```
